# Test multiple paths existing

created multigraph mg

added node A to mg
added node B to mg
added node x1 to mg
added node x2 to mg
added node y1 to mg
added node y2 to mg

added edge 7.000 from A to x1 in mg
added edge 7.000 from x1 to x2 in mg
added edge 7.000 from x2 to B in mg
added edge 8.000 from A to y1 in mg
added edge 8.000 from y1 to y2 in mg
added edge 8.000 from y2 to B in mg

path from A to B:
A to x1 with weight 7.000
x1 to x2 with weight 7.000
x2 to B with weight 7.000
total cost: 21.000
